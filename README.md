This app (service) automatically polls a server for it's status every given time, and parses JSON message from server and sets an Android notification accordingly.

The SampleAlarmReceiver and SampleBootReceiver boiler plate code is from this tutorial: https://developer.android.com/training/scheduling/wakelock.html

NB: This is not production code and should not be used as such.
