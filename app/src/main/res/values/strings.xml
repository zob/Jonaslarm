        This app checks a specific group of servers in specified intervals for their states and
        sets an android notification according to server response. Click START to start polling
        in background. The app itself can be closed after starting the service. Click CANCEL
        to cancel the polling (a bug here - it doesn\'t stop). Once the alarm is active, it
        automatically restarts when the device is rebooted (disabled feature for now).</string>
